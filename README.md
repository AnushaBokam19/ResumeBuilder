# AI Resume Builder — Build Track (Project 3)

This is a minimal React app that implements the routing, layout and gating system for the "AI Resume Builder — Build Track" inside the KodNest Premium Build System.

Routes:
- /rb/01-problem
- /rb/02-market
- /rb/03-architecture
- /rb/04-hld
- /rb/05-lld
- /rb/06-build
- /rb/07-test
- /rb/08-ship
- /rb/proof

Notes:
- Uses client-side routing with React Router.
- No resume building features implemented — only route rail + gating and proof page.
- Artifacts are stored in localStorage with keys `rb_step_X_artifact`.

Run:
- npm install
- npm run dev
